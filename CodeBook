The run_analysis.R script imports, cleans and analyzes the data in five tasks required from this project.

Raw data
The raw data was downloaded and unzipped under the folder called "UCI HAR Dataset"

Data processing
Assign each data to variables
features: dataframe, contains 561 rows, 2 columns; variable names: featureid (int), featurename (chr)
activities: dataframe, contains 6 rows, 2 columns; variable names: activityid (int), activity (chr) 
subject_test: dataframe, contains 2947 rows, 1 column; subject (int), describing 9/30 volunteer subjects
x_test: dataframe, contains 2947 rows, 561 columns; testing data of features, features are named by featurename
y_test: dataframe, contains 2947 rows, 1 columns; testing data of activities, variable name is activity
subject_train: dataframe, contains 7352 rows, 1 column; subject (int), describing 21/30 volunteer subjects
x_train: dataframe, contains 7352 rows, 561 columns; training data of features, features are names by featurename
y_train: dataframe, contains 7352 rows, 1 columns, training data of activities, variable name is activity

Merged data
merge_subject: dataframe, contains 10299 rows, 1 column, combination of subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function
merge_feature: dataframe, contains 10299 rows, 561 columns, combinaton of x_train and x_test using rbind() function
merge_activity: dataframe, contains 10299 rows, 1 column, combination of y_train and y_test using rbind() function
merged_data: datafram, contains 10299 rows, 563 columns, combination of merge_subject, merge_eature, merge_acvitity using cbind() function

Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
merged_data_new: dataframe, contains 10299 rows, 88 columns, selection of subject, code and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement

Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
activitydata: dataframe, contains 10299 rows, 68 columns, replacing the activity code with meaningful strings

Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
code column in TidyData renamed into activities
All start with character f in column’s name is replaced by frequency
All start with character t in column’s name is replaced by time
All Acc in column’s name is replaced by Accelerometer
All Gyro in column’s name is replaced by Gyroscope
All Mag in column’s name is replaced by Magnitude
All BodyBody in column’s name is replaced by Body

Independent clean dataset
newdata: dataframe, contains 180 rows, 68 columns, the final clean datasets. It is exported to newdata.csv uploaded in this repo.
